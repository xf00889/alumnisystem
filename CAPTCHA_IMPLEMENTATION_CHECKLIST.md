## Implementation Pattern

### Standard Implementation Template
```python
# 1. Import required modules
from core.recaptcha_fields import DatabaseReCaptchaField
from core.recaptcha_widgets import DatabaseReCaptchaV3
from core.recaptcha_utils import is_recaptcha_enabled

# 2. Add to form's __init__ method
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    
    # Add reCAPTCHA field if enabled in database
    if is_recaptcha_enabled():
        self.fields['captcha'] = DatabaseReCaptchaField(
            widget=DatabaseReCaptchaV3(
                attrs={
                    'data-callback': 'onRecaptchaSuccess',
                    'data-expired-callback': 'onRecaptchaExpired',
                    'data-error-callback': 'onRecaptchaError',
                }
            ),
            label='Security Verification'
        )
```

### Template Implementation
```html
<!-- Add to form template -->
{% if form.captcha %}
<div class="form-group">
    <label class="form-label">{{ form.captcha.label }}</label>
    {{ form.captcha }}
    <small class="form-text text-muted">
        <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> This helps us prevent spam and protect our system
    </small>
    {% if form.captcha.errors %}
        <div class="text-danger small mt-1">
            {% for error in form.captcha.errors %}{{ error }}{% endfor %}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
</div>
{% endif %}
```

## Security Benefits

### What CAPTCHA Protects Against:
1. **Spam Submissions** - Prevents automated form submissions
2. **Brute Force Attacks** - Protects login and password reset forms
3. **Account Creation Abuse** - Prevents automated account creation
4. **Financial Abuse** - Protects donation forms from automated abuse
5. **Content Spam** - Prevents spam in announcements, events, and feedback
6. **Communication Spam** - Protects messaging and connection systems

### Risk Assessment:
- **Critical Risk**: Login, Registration, Password Reset, Donations
- **High Risk**: Public content creation, Mentor applications, Job applications
- **Medium Risk**: Feedback, Messaging, Group memberships, Surveys
