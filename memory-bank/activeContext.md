# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on developing a messaging feature to enable direct communication between authenticated users in the system. This feature will allow users to search for other users, send private messages, view conversations in a threaded format, and receive notifications of new messages.

## Implementation Plan

- Register the app in INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
- Create URL patterns in norsu_alumni/urls.py

### 2. Data Models
- Create Message and Conversation models
- Implement UserMessagePreference for notification settings
- Use Django signals for message notifications
- Leverage existing User model for authentication

### 3. API Endpoints
- Build RESTful API with Django REST Framework
- Create views for conversation management
- Implement message CRUD operations
- Develop user search functionality

### 4. Frontend Development
- Design inbox UI with Bootstrap 5
- Create conversation thread view
- Implement user search and autocomplete
- Add notification indicators to existing navbar
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

### 5. Integration Points
- Connect with existing User and Profile models
- Add notification count to the site navigation
- Implement proper permission checks
- Add appropriate links in user profiles
