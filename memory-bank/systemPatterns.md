# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The Alumni System follows a Django-based MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with a focus on modularity and component-based design. The system is organized into distinct Django apps, each responsible for a specific domain of functionality.

## Core Design Patterns

### Model-View-Template (Django's MVC variant)
- **Models**: Define data structures and business logic
- **Views**: Handle HTTP requests and application logic
- **Templates**: Render HTML responses with dynamic data

### Component Architecture
- Each functional area is implemented as a separate Django app
- Apps maintain their own models, views, and templates
- Cross-cutting concerns use Django signals and middleware

### Authentication and Authorization
- Django's built-in auth system with custom user model extensions
- Role-based access control with permission checks
- Session management for authenticated users

### Data Access Patterns
- Django ORM for database operations
- QuerySet optimization for performance
- Cached queries for frequently accessed data

## Key Technical Decisions

### Backend Framework
- Django - Chosen for its comprehensive ecosystem, ORM, and admin capabilities

### Frontend Approach
- Bootstrap for responsive design and components
- JavaScript for dynamic interactions
- AJAX for asynchronous operations
- Custom CSS for specialized styling

### Data Storage
- SQLite for development
- PostgreSQL for production
- Django migrations for schema management

### API Architecture
- Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- Token-based authentication for API access
- JSON as the primary data exchange format

## Component Relationships

### User Management
- `accounts` app handles authentication, profiles, and user management
- Custom user model extends Django's AbstractUser
- Profile model linked to User via one-to-one relationship

### Alumni Directory
- `alumni_directory` app provides alumni search and profile display
- Alumni model extends user profile with professional information
- Experience model tracks work history and career progression

### Mentorship Program
- `mentorship` app manages mentor-mentee relationships
- Mentor model tracks mentoring availability and expertise
- Request model handles mentorship applications
- Timeline model tracks mentorship progress

### Content Management
- `announcements` app handles system notifications
- `events` app manages event creation and registration
- `jobs` app provides job posting and application features
- `surveys` app enables feedback collection

### Administrative Features
- Django admin site with customizations
- Custom admin views for specialized operations
- Admin-specific dashboards and reports

## Database Schema Highlights
- Normalized models with appropriate relationships
- Foreign keys maintaining referential integrity
- Abstract base classes for shared functionality
- Many-to-many relationships with through models where needed
- Careful use of indexes for query performance

## Frontend Component Structure
- Base templates with blocks for extension
- Reusable components as template includes
- Form handling with client and server validation
- Modal dialogs for interactive processes
- Mobile-responsive layouts with breakpoints
