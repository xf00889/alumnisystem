# Creating Groups

Learn how to create new alumni groups, configure group settings, and set up security questions for member verification.

## Overview

Creating an alumni group allows you to bring together alumni with shared interests, batch years, or professional goals. As a group creator, you become the group admin with full control over settings, membership, and content moderation.

## Who Can Use This Feature

- **Required**: Authenticated alumni account
- **Access Level**: All registered alumni users
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Verified email address
  - Completed profile setup
  - Good standing in the system

## How to Access

1. Log in to your alumni account
2. Navigate to **"Groups"** in the main navigation
3. Click the **"Create Group"** button (top right of the page)
4. You will be directed to the Group Creation form

**Alternative Access:**
- From your dashboard, click **"Create New Group"**
- From any group page, click **"Create Group"** in the header

## Before Creating a Group

### Check for Existing Groups

Before creating a new group, search for existing groups to avoid duplicates:

**Step-by-Step:**

1. Use the search function on the Groups List page
2. Search for keywords related to your intended group
3. Filter by batch year, course, and campus
4. Review existing groups carefully
5. Only create a new group if none exists

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents duplicate groups
- Consolidates alumni in one place
- Increases group engagement
- Reduces confusion for members

### Plan Your Group

Consider these questions before creating:

**Purpose:**
- What is the main purpose of this group?
- Who is the target audience?
- What activities will the group focus on?

**Membership:**
- Who should be able to join?
- Should membership require approval?
- Do you need security questions?

**Content:**
- What type of content will be shared?
- Should posts require approval?
- How will you moderate content?

**Management:**
- Who will help manage the group?
- How often will you check the group?
- What are your group rules?

## Group Creation Process

The system uses a two-phase creation process to ensure groups are properly configured and prevent duplicates.

### Phase 1: Basic Criteria

This phase collects information to check for duplicate groups.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. Click **"Create Group"** button

3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Batch Start Year**: Beginning year of the batch (e.g., 2015)
   - **Batch End Year**: Ending year of the batch (e.g., 2019)
   - **Course**: Select your course from the dropdown
   - **Campus**: Select the campus from the dropdown
4. Click **"Next"** to proceed to Phase 2

**Field Details:**

**Batch Start Year:**
- Required field
- Must be between 1900 and current year
- Represents when the batch started

**Batch End Year:**
- Required field
