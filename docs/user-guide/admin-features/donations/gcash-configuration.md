## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Initial Setup
Set up your first GCash account for the alumni system. Upload QR code, enter account details, and activate for immediate use with donation campaigns.

### Use Case 2: Department-Specific Accounts
Create separate GCash configurations for different departments (Scholarship Office, Infrastructure, Events) to track donations separately.

### Use Case 3: Replacing QR Code
Your GCash QR code changed. Edit the configuration, upload new QR code, and save. Existing campaigns automatically use the new QR code.

### Use Case 4: Temporary Deactivation
Temporarily deactivate a GCash account during maintenance or investigation. Campaigns using it continue to work, but new campaigns cannot select it.
