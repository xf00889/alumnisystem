## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot Enable Donations
**Symptoms**: "Allow Donations" checkbox is disabled or GCash dropdown is empty
**Solution**: 
- Ensure at least one GCash configuration exists and is active
- Navigate to **Donations > GCash Configuration** to set up payment account
- GCash configuration must have a QR code uploaded
- Refresh the campaign form after setting up GCash

### Issue: Campaign Not Appearing on Donations Page
**Symptoms**: Created campaign doesn't show in public listings
**Solution**: 
- Verify campaign status is set to "Active" (not Draft)
- Check visibility settings match your viewing context (logged in vs. public)
- Ensure campaign start date is not in the future
- Clear browser cache and refresh the donations page

### Issue: Slug Already Exists Error
**Symptoms**: Error message about duplicate slug when saving
**Solution**: 
- The system auto-generates slugs from campaign names
- If a campaign with similar name exists, modify the campaign name slightly
- Add year or specific identifier to make name unique
- Example: "Scholarship Fund" → "Scholarship Fund 2025"

### Issue: Cannot Select GCash Configuration
**Symptoms**: GCash dropdown is empty or desired account not listed
**Solution**: 
- Verify GCash configuration is marked as "Active"
- Ensure GCash configuration has a QR code uploaded
- Check that you have permission to view GCash configurations
- Contact system administrator if issue persists

### Issue: Featured Image Not Displaying
**Symptoms**: Uploaded image doesn't appear in preview or on campaign page
**Solution**: 
- Verify image file size is under 5MB
- Use supported formats (JPG, PNG)
- Check image dimensions are reasonable (recommended: 1200x630px)
- Try uploading a different image to rule out file corruption
- Clear browser cache after uploading
