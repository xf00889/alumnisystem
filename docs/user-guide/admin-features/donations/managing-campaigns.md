## Tips and Best Practices

- **Regular Monitoring**: Check campaign progress daily during active fundraising
- **Status Updates**: Keep campaign status current to reflect actual state
- **Goal Adjustments**: Don't change goals after donations start unless absolutely necessary
- **Transparency**: If pausing or cancelling, communicate reasons to stakeholders
- **Completion**: Mark campaigns as completed promptly when goals are reached
- **Data Preservation**: Never delete campaigns with donations; use "Cancelled" status instead
- **Featured Management**: Rotate featured campaigns to highlight different causes
- **End Dates**: Set realistic end dates and extend if needed rather than leaving open-ended
- **Progress Updates**: Post campaign updates to keep donors engaged
- **Donor Recognition**: Acknowledge donors through campaign updates

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Extending Campaign Timeline
A scholarship campaign is close to its goal but end date is approaching. Edit the campaign to extend the end date by 30 days, giving more time to reach the goal.

### Use Case 2: Pausing for Review
An infrastructure campaign needs budget review. Pause the campaign temporarily, add a note explaining the review process, and resume once approved.

### Use Case 3: Early Completion
An emergency relief campaign reaches its goal ahead of schedule. Mark as completed, add a thank-you message, and create a new campaign if additional funds are needed.

### Use Case 4: Correcting Campaign Details
After launch, you notice a typo in the campaign description. Edit the campaign, fix the error, and save without changing other settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot Delete Campaign
**Symptoms**: Delete button is disabled or error message appears when attempting deletion
**Solution**: 
- Check if campaign has any donations (even pending ones)
- Campaigns with donations cannot be deleted to preserve financial records
- Use "Cancelled" status instead to remove from active listings
- Contact system administrator if you believe deletion should be allowed

### Issue: Status Change Not Reflecting
**Symptoms**: Changed campaign status but it still appears in old status
**Solution**: 
- Verify you clicked Save after changing status
- Clear browser cache and refresh the page

### Issue: Progress Percentage Incorrect
**Symptoms**: Progress bar or percentage doesn't match actual donations
**Solution**:

- Pending donations are not included in progress
- Verify donations have been marked as "Completed" status
- Check that goal amount is correct
- System recalculates on page refresh

### Issue: Cannot Edit Campaign
**Symptoms**: Edit button is missing or edit form won't open
**Solution**: 
- Verify you have admin or staff permissions
- Check if campaign is locked by another administrator
- Try logging out and back in
- Clear browser cache
- Contact system administrator if issue persists

### Issue: GCash Configuration Cannot Be Changed
**Symptoms**: GCash dropdown is disabled or shows error
**Solution**: 
- Verify new GCash configuration is active and has QR code
