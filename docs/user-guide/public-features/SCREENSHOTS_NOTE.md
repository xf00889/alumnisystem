## How to Add Screenshots

1. **Capture Screenshots**
   - Use the actual NORSU Alumni System
   - Capture high-quality screenshots (1920x1080 or similar)
   - Use PNG format for clarity
   - Ensure no sensitive information is visible

2. **Edit Screenshots**
   - Add annotations/arrows where helpful
   - Highlight important UI elements
   - Crop to relevant areas
   - Ensure text is readable

3. **Organize Files**
   - Save to: `docs/user-guide/screenshots/public-features/`
   - Use descriptive filenames:
     - `announcements-list.png`
     - `announcements-search.png`
     - `events-detail.png`
     - `donations-form.png`
     - `registration-form.png`
     - etc.

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Add image references in markdown files
   - Use format: `![Description](../../screenshots/public-features/filename.png)`
   - Add captions where helpful
   - Ensure images are referenced in context

## Example Image Reference

```markdown
### Browse Announcements

1. Navigate to the announcements page
   
   ![Announcements List Page](../../screenshots/public-features/announcements-list.png)
   *The announcements list showing active public announcements*

2. Use the search box to find specific announcements
   
   ![Search Functionality](../../screenshots/public-features/announcements-search.png)
   *Search results filtering announcements by keyword*
```

## Priority

Screenshots are helpful but not critical for the documentation to be useful. The written guides provide comprehensive step-by-step instructions that users can follow. Screenshots should be added when:

1. The system is in a stable state
2. UI design is finalized
3. Time permits for proper screenshot capture and editing
4. Someone with access to the system can capture them

## Alternative

If screenshots cannot be captured immediately:
- Documentation is still complete and usable
- Users can follow written instructions
- Screenshots can be added incrementally over time
- Consider using placeholder text like "Screenshot coming soon" in strategic locations
